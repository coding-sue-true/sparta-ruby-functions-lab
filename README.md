# sparta-ruby-functions-lab

## Main

Lab performed in class to test our knowledge regarding using functions using ruby.

Here's an example how it looked before solved:

```
# Write a function that multiplies two numbers and returns the result
# multiply
def multiply num1, num2
  #insert your code here
end

# Write a function that multiplies three numbers and returns the result
# add_three
def add_three num1, num2, num3
  #insert your code here
end

```
If everything was working properly, a test was ran (you can see it inside the 'spec' folder) and the results should turn green.
